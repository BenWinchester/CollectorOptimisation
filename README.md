# CollectorOptimisation

This repository contains Python-based software for optimising the design parameters for solar collectors. The input parameters which specify the bounds of the optimisation(s) and the initial conditions (design) of the collector(s) are kept separate from the code, which runs over the designs and determines the most optimum configuration by utilising a Bayesian optimisation[[1]](#1) process.
