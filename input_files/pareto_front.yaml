# The Pareto front is the set of optimal systems of which no one system is optimum. In
# more simple terms, if there are a range of systems which could be optimal depending on
# a weighting factor, then all of these systems can be optimal.
#
# NOTE: Depending on the underlying model being optimised, the keywords here need to be
# specified and altered.
